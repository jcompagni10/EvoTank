      <h2> What the heck is this? </h2>
      <p> evoTanks is a cross between a 2d tank shooter game and a genetics simulation.
        At its core it allows a human player to face off against a constantly improving AI.</p>
      <h3> The AI </h3>
      <p>At its base the Tanki's AI is built with path-finding(breadth first search), targeting, and bullet avoidance logic. On top of this, the AI also has a number of adjustable traits wich modulate its agressiveness, sensitivity to incoming bullets, and targeting range. For the first 10 rounds the game generates AI with randomly selected traits. After a base population has been established winning AI are allowed to pass on their genes sucessssive generations through a genetic inheritance algorithm. Overtime the AI i able to effectively adapt its behvaviour to a given style of play.</p>
      <h3> The Map </h3>
      <p>To insure an enjoyable user experience and to prevent the AI from stagnating at a local optimum, a new map is randomly generated for each round. Maps are randomly generated using a recusrive division algorithm.</p>
